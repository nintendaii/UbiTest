# AppLovin SDK
Setting up SDK:
1. Clone this project and open the project in the Unity Editor.
2. Under `File > Build Settings`, click on the mobile platform of choice and click on `Player Settings`.
3. Update the iOS bundle identifier and/or Android package name with your own unique identifier(s) associated with the application you will create in the MAX dashboard (or already created, if it is an existing app).
4. Paste `android-keys.json` and/or `ios-keys.json` files to the `Assets` folder.
5. Go to `AppLovin > Integration > Mediated Networks`. Import GoogleAdMob package and paste Android/iOS App ID`s.
6. Build your project.

# Facebook SDK
Setting up SDK:
1. Go to `Facebook > Edit Settings` and paste your App ID.
2. Follow [these steps](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/unity/getting-started/android)
## Important
Currently the share screenshot logic is implemented via [NativeShare Pluggin](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare). 
The reason it works this way is because Facebook [depreciated](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/07/31/platform-update-publish-permission/?locale=ru_RU) `publish_actions` permission.

More research is needed to implement the sharing functionality via Facebook SDK. It would be a good solution to create
a plugin or to play around with Facebook API.

# CI / CD

See all jobs in [workflow](https://github.com/nintendaii/UbiTest/tree/main/.github/workflows) folder. More time is needed to automate all builds,
sdk keys, player settings etc.
